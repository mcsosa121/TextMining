Entropy (20 questions - I'm thinking of something and have to use yes or no questions to guess whats going on)

Anne
tree - 0.5, bird 0.25, car 0.25

is it a tree?
  /     \
  Yes    No 
          |
      is it a bird?
       /      \
       Yes    No
       |       |
       bird   car 
The Entropy of a distribuiton is the expect number of questions to guess values sampled from that distribuiton
-0.5log(0.5) + -0.25log(0.25) + -0.25log(0.25) = 1.5                              where log base 2
From prob dist -> binary scripts (Huffman encoding)
What if you're using the wrong script?

now have bertha
tree - 0.25, bird - 0.25, car - 0.5
How much worse will we do if using anne's script for bertha's distribuiton
Can you do better using the wrong encoding (ie. not the optimal)
Jensens inequality says no (can't do better than the right prob distribuiton)
