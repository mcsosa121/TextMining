What is the theme of a novel.
What does it mean for that novel?
- REvenge, Adventures, Coming of age, Short Stories, ... etc

Could say that most horror story then facial expresssions might come up a lot

The titles in brackets are human generated although we noticed taht they were weird for some reason

with talking about fires. We are almost finding the "footprints" that literary writers have left within
their works.

Would need a consistent dataset.
